- Change behavior of track skip back. If more than 5 seconds into track then got back to start of current track, otherwise go to start of previous track.
- Save and restore last shuffle order so that when app restarted and current track resumed we continue the previous play order. Avoids replaying the same track/album soon after a restart. Order is still reshuffled when changing genres, changing shuffle mode, etc.
- Disable Proguard on release build
